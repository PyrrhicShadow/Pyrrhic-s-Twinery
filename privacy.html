            <h2>Privacy</h2>
             <p>Welcome to the CarboEmerald's Twinery privacy policy.</p>
             <p>CarboEmerald's Twinery is a site hosted on GitHub pages.  GitHub's privacy policy can be found <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
             <h3>Why is information collected?</h3>
             <p>As an interactive fiction writer/programmer, I find it important for my own learning process to learn how players interact with my projects, so I collect additional information from players interacting with my Twine projects.</p>
             <h3>What is collected?</h3>
             <p>The types of information that I collect include the following:</p>
             <p><ul>
                 <li>Data that you enter into one of my Twine projects (character name, character gender, etc)</li>
                 <li>The route you take within one of my Twine projects, including passage history and variables counting certain actions within the project.</li>
             </ul></p>
             <h3>How it is used?</h3>
             <p>The information collected will only be used by me to improve my projects.  This information is collected when you play one of my Twine projects.  If you would rather not have your information collected, don't interact with any of my Twine projects.</p>
             <h3>Revisions</h3>
             <p>This privacy policy was last revised on 08 July 2020. New revisions of this policy will be posted on this webpage.</p>
