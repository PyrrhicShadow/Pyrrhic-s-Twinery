                <h3>Version 0.0.006</h3>
                <p>Version <a href="twine/Not-Weird-Queer-0-0-006.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0.0.006</a> is a bug fix for the v. 0.0.005 female-route name prompt issue.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Known issue</strong>: when choosing a name, the Harlowe engine will occasionally display an error message. If you click "OK" on the message, the game will resume normally.</li>
                    <li>Loop logic now depends on $loop, a variable tracking the absolute day as written in the code. Each unique day has a unique $loop number, and $loop numbers repeat when days repeat.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you find any errors in the loop logic, such as skipping days, sequentially repeated days, or events appearing on the wrong days, please submit a <a href="https://forms.gle/mc2JKRCaoz9jvtki9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bug report</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>v. 0.0.005  bug fixes:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed the bug where the female path is unplayable because the prompt for choosing a name in that path is broken.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Known bug</strong>: if you input a name that is already the ally's name or your deadname, the Harlowe engine will run into an error.</li>
                </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Fix the bug where if you come out to the ally on the 4th day after day 1 (day 5, day 9, etc), the game will run into an error and send you home instead of taking you to the book club.</li>
                        <li>Fixed numerous instances where the name "Ryan" was hard-coded into the text instead of dynamically showing the name of ally for the current play-through.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Known bug</strong>: if you input a name that is already the ally's name or your deadname, the Harlowe engine will run into an error.</li>

                    <li>Slight part 1 point-based action balance tweaks and changes to dummy text and skeleton pages. </li>
                    <li>v. 0.0.003 bug fixes:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed the bug where every 4th day after day 3 (day 7, day 11, etc.), if you choose to talk to the ally during PE after defending your gender, you will skip lunch that day.</li>

                    <ul>
                    <li>Completely overhauled the story loop.</li>
                    <li>Reworked the point-based action balances for hidden variables:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each applicable action only increases or decreases happiness by one point at most.</li>
                        <li>No actions affect self-esteem points - these are calculated at the end of each day and are cumulative.</li>
                        <li>Added ally points that affect the progress of part 1 at certain thresholds.</li>
                    </ul>
